## Step 1: Closure

We have an array with the numbers from 1 to 1000. Now we are interested in all numbers in that array which are divisible by 3. And then divisible by 10. And then by 21. We have implemented that using for loops:

```js
  let arr = [];
   for( let i=1; i<=1000;i++){
       arr.push(i);
   }
   console.log(arr);

   // here the solution using loops starts
   const x = 3;
   let divisbleBy3 = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]%x===0){
           divisbleBy3.push(arr[i]);
       }
   }
   console.log("Numbers divisible by 3: ",divisbleBy3);
   console.log("Amount of numbers divisible by 3: ",divisbleBy3.length);

   const y = 10;
   let divisbleBy10 = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]%y===0){
           divisbleBy10.push(arr[i]);
       }
   }
   console.log("Numbers divisible by 10: ",divisbleBy10);
   console.log("Amount of numbers divisible by 10: ",divisbleBy10.length);

   const z = 21;
   let divisbleBy21 = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]%z===0){
           divisbleBy21.push(arr[i]);
       }
   }
   console.log("Numbers divisible by 21: ",divisbleBy21);
   console.log("Amount of numbers divisible by 21: ",divisbleBy21.length);
```

Your task is now, to implement a closure (a function factory), that generates functions which allow us to determine all numbers that are divisible by "WHAT EVER NUMBER".

>Hint: Use `map`, `filter` and `reduce`. Think about the sizes of your arrays and then choose whether you need `map`, `filter` or `reduce`

```js
    let arr = [];
    for( let i=1; i<=1000;i++){
        arr.push(i);
    }
    console.log(arr);

    // here please start your solution
    // using closures, functions and (map,filter,reduce)
    const divisibleFactory = function(z){

    }

    // apply your function
    // const divisbleByWHATEVERNUMBER = arr ... WHATEVERNUMBER ... ;
```

Once you have the factory function above working well for 3, 10 and 21, create an array which uses this factory above to calculate the number of item in `arr` above which are divisible by numbers between 1-30 i.e. your array will contain 30 items and looks something like this:

```js
[1000, 500, 333, 250, 200, 166, 142, 125, 111, 100, 90, 83, 76, 71, 66, 62, 58, 55, 52, 50, 47, 45, 43, 41, 40, 38, 37, 35, 34, 33, 32]

// 1000 items are divisible by 1, 500 by 2 and son on...
```
